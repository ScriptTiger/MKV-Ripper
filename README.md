# MKV Ripper
MKV Ripper is an FFmpeg script to enumerate video and audio streams within a container, not only MKV, and losslessly stream copy them to individual files.

To use, simply drag and drop your MKV, or other container, over the `MKV-Ripper.cmd` file and wait for it to export the files to the same directory as the source container.

If you're having issues and find the codecs you're using are not currently supported, please reach out so we can add support for them!
